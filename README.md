# user_interface
This includes a sampling of work from my Building User Interfaces course work. The professor had generally intended code solutions to be private for academic integrity and for the security of the APIs that we were using, if you would like to review my code for purposes of resume/portfolio review I am happy to share private repositories with you directly.

I have organized MP4 screen recordings that accompanied my homework submissions by category. 

_Important Note:_ The MP4 recordings can take a while to load. You may want to download them from the links and view locally depending on your computer and internet.
